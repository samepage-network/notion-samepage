The SamePage Roam extension allows you to connect your Notion Workspace to other notebooks using the SamePage Network. A **Notebook** in Notion is a full team or individual workspace.

## Installing the Live Version

The SamePage connection is still under review by the Notion team. Until then, you could install it directly from the SamePage website by visiting our [install](/install?id=notion) page or by [clicking here](https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/authorize?client_id=1990c3a3-66ff-4a69-8d22-af684683daf5&response_type=code&owner=user&redirect_uri=https://samepage.network/oauth/notion)!
